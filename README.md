## Setting up the project

The first thing you do when starting any modern JavaScript project is initialize
it (`cd` into your project directory and):

```bash
npm init
```

You will be asked to provide values for certain keys. The `name` will default to
the current directory. It's perfectly fine to just enter through everything.
This will create a `package.json` file. This file defines everything about your
package in order to publish it to npm, define  development dependencies and
project dependencies, to run arbitrary scripts, as well interoperate with other
tools. For example, linters, like [jshint][jshint] can have it's options
specified from either a `.jshintrc` file or inside `package.json` under the
`jshint` key. After running this, my `package.json` looks like this (I switched
to MIT license):

```json
