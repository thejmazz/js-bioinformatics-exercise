## Setting up the project

The first thing you do when starting any modern JavaScript project is initialize
it (`cd` into your project directory and):

```bash
npm init
```

You will be asked to provide values for certain keys. The `name` will default to
the current directory. It's perfectly fine to just enter through everything.
This will create a `package.json` file. This file defines everything about your
package in order to publish it to npm, define  development dependencies and
project dependencies, to run arbitrary scripts, as well as interoperate with
other tools. For example, linters, like [jshint][jshint] can have it's options
specified from either a `.jshintrc` file or inside `package.json` under the
`jshint` key. After running this, my `package.json` looks like this (I switched
to MIT license):

```json
{
  "name": "js-bioinformatics-exercise",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "The tutorial for this [exercise][exercise] as part of my presentation on [JavaScript and Bioinformatics][js-and-bioinformatics].",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/thejmazz/js-bioinformatics-exercise.git"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/thejmazz/js-bioinformatics-exercise/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/thejmazz/js-bioinformatics-exercise#readme"
}
```

## Getting Dependencies

Let's get started by downloading [bionode-ncbi][bionode-ncbi] **and** making
sure to store it under our dependencies by using the `--save` option:

```bash
npm install bionode-ncbi --save
```

You'll now notice the following has been added to the `package.json`

```json
{
    ...
    "dependencies": {
        "bionode-ncbi": "^1.6.0"
    }
}
```

As well, `bionode-ncbi` lives at `node_modules/bionode-ncbi`. You don't commit
this `node_modules` folder - when someone downloads this package they can simply
run `npm install` and it will install everything under the `dependencies` and
`devDependencies` keys. Thus managing dependencies in the npm ecosystem is
simple *and* robust. Note as well, when we installed bionode-ncbi, it ran `npm
install` inside the bionode-ncbi folder, and ever deeper for each dependency.
